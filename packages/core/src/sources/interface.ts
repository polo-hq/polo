 * The extension contract for source adapters.

 * Only `describe()` is required. Implement whichever subset of the optional
 * methods matches the underlying shape of your data source. The orchestrator
 * receives tools derived from whichever methods you implement — nothing more.
 *
 * Access patterns:
 * - Path-based: implement `list` and/or `read`
 * - Query-based: implement `search`
 * - Capability-based: implement `tools`
 *
 * @example Plain object with search (e.g. a vector store):
 * ```ts
 * const notes: SourceAdapter = {
 *   describe: () => "Clinical notes, searchable by semantic similarity.",
 *   search: async (query) => myVectorSearch(query),
 *   read: async (id) => fetchById(id),
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Plain object with tools (e.g. a database):
 * ```ts
 * const db: SourceAdapter = {
 *   describe: () => "Patient database. Use the provided tools to query it.",
 *   tools: () => ({
 *     search_patients: tool({ ... }),
 *     get_patient: tool({ ... }),
 *   }),
